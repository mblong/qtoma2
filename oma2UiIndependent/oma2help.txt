CMINMX n m 
	Specifies the minimum (n) and maximum (m) values in the data that correspond to the minimum and maximum color or gray scale values. Specifying the values causes the "Auto Scale" feature to be disabled. If the arguments are not given, the "Auto Scale" feature is enabled.

CYL2
	Treat the data in the current image as a half cross section of a cylindrically symmetric intensity distribution. The centerline is assumed to be along the LHS of the image. An integrated image is calculated by rotating the image  about the centerline. Does a parallel projection.

CLEARBADPIX

	Opens a window on the Macintosh screen and displays the contents of the current data buffer. The color palette used can be determined by the PALETTE command. The color minimum and maximum are specified by the CMINMX command. There can be up to 9 image windows open at one time. Windows can be resized, moved around the screen, and closed as in other Macintosh applications. If the optional string is specified, the window will be named according to the string.

DMACRO [n] [command]
	Prompts the user for lines of a command macro to be executed using the RMACRO command. If the argument n is omitted, definition starts with line one. If n is specified, definition begins with the nth line of the macro. To include numerical arguments that change each time the macro is executed, %d can be inserted in the macro command at the location where the number will be placed upon execution of the macro. If "command" is not present, the program prompts for additional command lines until a null command is entered (i.e. <CR> only). If the optional "command" is included on the same line, the text of "command" replaces any command already existing at line n and no further command lines are solicited. Dummy arguments in Macros or Execute files include the following:

DOC2RGB c1 c2 c3 c4
	Treat the image in the current image buffer as a raw document (output from the dcraw routine with options -d or -D selected) and convert it to an RGB image. This is assumed to have a 2 x 2 color matrix of R G B values in a Bayer pattern. c1 - c4 have values 0, 1 or 2, corresponding to red, green, and blue. For example, if Bayer Matrix is:
	G B
	R G
	c1 - c4 should be 1 2 0 1
	Appropriate values depend on the specific camera. (See the output from the GET command when reading raw files.)

DOC2COLOR c1 c2 c3 c4 c5
	Treat the image in the current image buffer as a raw document (e.g., output from the dcraw routine with options -d or -D selected) and convert it to an R, G, or B image. This is assumed to have a 2 x 2 color matrix of R G B values in a Bayer pattern. c1 - c4 have values 0, 1 or 2, corresponding to red, green, and blue. For example if Bayer Matrix is
	G B
	R G
	c1 - c4 should be 1 2 0 1
	c5 is 0, 1, or 2 for conversion to red, green, or blue. Pixels associated with non-selected colors have a value of 0. Doing a BLOCK 2 2 command after this command will remove the zeros. Blocking 2 by 2 on the green channel will sum the two green pixels.

DISP2RGB

DEMOSAIC redX redY [algorithm]
	Assume the current image is a raw Bayer intensity profile and perform demosaicing to produce an RGB image of the same size with three color channels. redX and redY are the x and y coordinates of the first red pixel and must be either 0 or 1 (default is 0, 0). The optional algorithm value specifies what demosaicing algorithm to apply. 0 -> bilinear (default). 1 -> Malvar.

DECODEHOBJ
	Assume the current image has the proprietary .hobj format (from Halcon), and has not been decoded. This attempts to decode the image. See the command HOBJSETTINGS for how this decoding can be done automatically.

DSATURATE [displaySaturationValue]
	This affects how the display command behaves when the Scale option is selected. If a displaySaturationValue is specified, the Color Max value used will be the dataMaxium*displaySaturationValue. If no argument is given, the current value is printed.

ERASE [n]
	If no argument is given, all image windows currently on the screen are closed. If a value n is specified, only window n is erased.

	Sets an exposure time to be used in generating HDR images. If no argument is given, the value of the current exposure is echoed.

EXTRA [index] [value]
	Add extra information to the current image in the form of a floating point value. Indexing starts at 1. If both arguments are present, the value is placed at the location specified by the index. If no argument is given, the command lists extra values in the current image buffer and puts the first ten extra values into the command_return variables. With one argument, the extra value at the specified index is put into command_return_1.

	mode = 5  return the log of the magnitude squared scaled by scale_factor
	mode = 6  return the magnitude squared scaled by scale_factor
	mode = 7  return the autocorrelation scaled by scale_factor
	mode = 8  return inverse - input is a filter scaled by n

FLOATVARIABLE variable_name
	Specifies that variable_name is to be used as a floating point variable.

FLOATAUTO <flag>
    If flag is nonzero, assignment of a variable to a floating point value will set its type to FLOAT. If flag is 0, the default INTEGER data type will be used. With no argument, the current value of the flag is echoed.

FOLD fraction new_width
	Fold an image in half vertically. It is assumed to be symmetric about some nearly verticle axis. The center of symmetry is found separately for each row, except if there are dark regions at the top and bottom of the image. For the dark regions, the average center of the middle part of the image is used as the center of symmetry. Dark regions are rows (at the top and bottom) whose values are all less than fraction*image_max. x0,y0 and x1,y1 are coordinates of the top and bottom of the dark region, center is the average center. These are returned in command_return_1-5.

FTEMPIMAGE tempImage
	Free memory associated with temporary image tempImage. tempImage must be in the range 0-9, or correspond to a named image. If no argument is specified, all temporary images are freed.

FCLOSE
	Closes the currently open text file (there can be only one). The use of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a file from within a macro.

FECHO string
	Writes the string to the file opened with FOPEN. A newLine is added after the string unless the string ends in ..., in which case no newLine is added. The use of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a file from within a macro.

FOPEN <filename>
	Open a text file with the name <filename> for I/O. The use of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a file from within a macro.

FRAME NewWidth NewHeight [Value] [X0] [Y0]
	Put a "frame" around the current image. X0 and Y0 are the coordinates of the start of the new image in the current image's coordinate system. X0 and Y0 can be positive (will crop out some of the current image) or negative (The new image will have a border with the pixels containing the Value specified). If X0 or Y0 are not integers, the routine will interpolate pixel values. Default Value is 0. Default of X0 and Y0 center the old image in the frame.

FRAMECNTR CenterX HalfWidth [Y0] [Y1] [Value]
Put a "frame" around the current image centered on column CenterX. The new image width will be 2*HalfWidth+1. Y0 and Y1 specify where the top and bottom of the new image start. Their default values are 0 and originalImageHeight-1. If the new image is larger than the original image, data values are set to Value (default is 0).

FINDBADPIX Counts [TargetValue] [Passes]
	Searches the current image buffer for pixels whose value is more than "Counts" above that of its nearest eight neighbors. Those pixels are tagged as hot pixels. This is best applied to a dark image. If the optional TargetValue is specified, a different algorithm is used that will get values from 1 to 8 neighboring pixels that are within the specified number of counts of the target value. A reasonable TargetValue would be the average A/D offset, e.g., from a dark frame. As currently implemented, the alternate algorithm is not appropriate for raw images from a color camera. The information is saved in an internal buffer. See also CLEARBADPIX, CCLEARBADPIX, WRITEBADPIX, and READBADPIX.

FWDATMATLAB  <filename> [delimiter]
	Writes the data in the current buffer as a text file. If no delimiter is specified, tab is used and the file will have the Save File extension. If the delimeter is "," the file gets the .csv extension. Format is a matrix of values that can be loaded directly into matlab.

FLIPPID Nx NcLow NcHigh Power Background
	Perform an inverse Abel transform using the FLiPPID method. The current image must satisfy these conditions: (1) it is a right-side-up, full axisymmetric flame image with an odd number of columns. (2) The flame must be perfectly centered on the center of the image. Nx should be slightly larger than the maximum width (in pixels) of the flame. NcLow and NcHigh relate to a range of radial locations of the maximum; values of -500 and 2500, respectively seem to work for several flames I tested. Power is the power used in the fitting function, and could range from 3 - 7 or more. Higher powers seem to work better for flames with thin soot regions at the edges. Rows with maximum counts less than Background will be filled with 0. The image buffer returns the Abel inverted image. A temporary image named proj is also created -- this is the projected image created from the fitting function and can be comared with the original image to assess the quality of the fit. A lookup table is created based on the values of Nx, NcLow, NcHigh, and Power. The table is saved to a file in a folder named flippidMatrices in the path specified by the Save Data Files preference. Before calculating a new table, the program checks to see if an appropriate table already exists.

GET <filename>
	Loads the data from the specified file into the current image data buffer. The "Get Data Files" prefix is used. The "Get Data Files" suffix is used unless the specified filename has a suffix of .jpg, .tiff, .tif, or .nef; in those cases no suffix is added and the appropriate decoding routines are called according to the file type.

GETFILENAMES NameFile
	Open NameFile (uses GET DATA FILES prefix and ".txt" as suffix), which contains the names of files. The NEXTFILE command is used to open the next file. NameFile is left open until all files have been accessed. NameFile can be generated with a SHELL command. See also NEXTFILE command.

GETFOLDERNAMES FolderFile
	Open FolderFile (uses GET DATA FILES prefix and ".txt" as suffix), which contains the names of folders. The NEXTFOLDER command is used to read the next folder name. FolderFile is left open until all folders have been accessed. FolderFile can be generated with a SHELL command. See also NEXTFOLDER command.
 
GETMATCH parameterfile
	Load the file matching parameters contained in the text file "parameterfile". The format of the file is as follows:
x1_ref y1_ref x1_i1 y1_i1 x1_i2 y1_i2
x2_ref y2_ref x2_i1 y2_i1 x2_i2 y2_i2
image1_width image1_height
image2_width image2_height

GETSETTINGS [filename]
	Gets settings from the specified file (uses the appropriate prefix and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is given, OMA Settings from within the oma application are loaded.

GETFUNCTION n filename
	Read in a tabulated function to be used by the LOOKUP command. n is the function number to be defined. filename is file containing y=f(x) data pairs, preceeded by number of table entries.
	Assumptions for tabulated functions:
	File format:
	first number is integer with the number of pairs to follow
	pairs are float with x followed by f(x) on the same line
	x values are ordered smallest to largest
	y = f(x) is single valued

GETBINARYFILE <filename> rows columns headerBytes bytesPerDataPoint swapBytesFlag [unsignedFlag]
	Read in a binary file with the specified parameters. If bytesPerDataPoint is -sizeof(float), the binary data are treated as float. Other reasonable values would be 1, 2, or 4. Specified parameters do not change those set with the BINARGUMENTS command.

GETANGLE fraction
For images consisting of tall, symmetric, narrow structures nearly aligned with the vertical axis (think axisymmetric laminar flames), this calculates the angle (in degrees) that the current image needs to be rotated to align the x center of mass with the y axis. This is done using a linear least squares fit of the vetical coordinate and horizontal center of mass coordinate. The entire image width is used. The start of the rectangle considered begins where the maximum along a horizontal line is greater than "fraction" of the maximum and continues until the maximum along a horizontal line falls below "fraction" of the maximum. The required rotation angle and center of mass x location are returned. After a rotation by the calculated amount, the angle returned should be small (say < .1 degree) and the location of the center of mass should correspond to the center of the symmetric image. (See also FRAMECNTR.) 

GMACRO <filename>
	Loads the contents of the specified file into the current macro buffer.

GAUSSIAN EdgeValue [x0 y0]
	Generate a Gaussian distribution centered at x0, y0. If x0, and y0, are not specified, the distribution is centered. The maximum is 1. For a centered distribution, EdgeValue specifies the value of the distribution at the center edge.

If no argument is given, all command names are printed with no explanation.

HDRACADD
	Adds the current image data buffer to the HDR accumulator buffer. Values greater than the cutoff are excluded and values are then normalized by the exposure time.

HDRACCUMULATE cutoffMax cutoffMin
	Allocates and clears memory for an HDR accumulator that can be used to generate HDR images from a series of different exposures. The cuttoff value should be less than the saturation value for the detector. Values less than cutoffMin are not included; the default for cutoffMin is 0. The size of the accumulator is determined by the image size parameters when the accumulate command is first given. Be sure the exposure value for the image is set (e.g., imported from a raw file or set using the EXPOSURE command).

HOBJSETTINGS <decodeFlag> <demosaicSetting> <clearBadPixelsFlag>
	With no arguments, this command gives information on how .hobj files will be read in. If arguments are given, the decodeFlag, demosaicSetting, and clearBadPixelsFlag are specified. A nonzero decodeFlag will cause automatic decoding of .hobj files when they are read in. The demosaicSetting has the following values/meanings: 0 = no demosaicing done (appropriate for monochrome images); 1 = treat as a color image and demosaic using DOC2RGB 0 1 1 2; 2 = treat as a color image and demosaic using the bilinear algorithm with the red pixel at 0,0; 3 = treat as a color image and demosaic using the Malvar algorithm with the red pixel at 0,0. If the clearBadPixelsFlag is set, bad pixels previously specified with FINDBAD or READBAD will be set to the average of their eight nearest neighbors (of the same color -- assumes this is a raw color image).

IF condition
	If condition evaluates to a non-zero value, the commands following the IF are executed. However, if the condition is zero, the commands between IF and ENDIF are not executed. The condition can be any arithmetic statement and can include logical operators < (less than), > (greater than), others to come....

IFNOT condition
	If condition evaluates to a ZERO value, the commands following the IF are executed. However, if the condition is nonzero, the commands between IF and ENDIF are not executed. The condition can be any arithmetic statement and can include logical operators < (less than), > (greater than), others to come....

INVERT
	Inverts the image in the current image data buffer, causing the first data point to become the last data point.

INTEGRATE direction_flag selection_flag do_average
	Sum up the data in the horizontal ( direction_flag=0 ) or vertical (direction_flag=1)direction. The two-dimensional image becomes a single line. If selection_flag=1, the subset of the image specified by the selection rectangle is used. Possible cases are:
	direction_flag = 1 The result is an array in x; sum in y direction
	direction_flag = 0 The result is an array in y; sum in x direction
	selection_box = 1 A selection box specifies what region to sum
	selection_box = 0 Sum all channels or tracks 
	do_average = 1 Average along the integrate direction (divide by box size in integration direction)
	do_average = 0 Just sum, don't average

INTFILL direction_flag selection_flag do_average
	This works like the INTEGRATE command but a two-dimensional image is formed by duplicating the summed values. If selection_flag=1, the new image will be the size of the currently defined rectangle.

INTVARIABLE variable_name
	Specifies that variable_name is to be used as an integer variable.

IM2SEQUENCE filename frames
	Save the current image as a sequence of images with the specified number of frames. This type of data file can be used by the SEQ2HDR command.

KILLBOX [value]
	Much like FILLBOX, this command works on the region of the image that has been specified with the RECT command or mouse. The contents of this region are set to 'value'. Default for 'value' is 0.

KWABEL n
	Uses analytic evaluation of integral required for abel inversion, which involves a lot of evaluations of ln(x). n is a scale factor for the image.

LIST
	Lists the current detector parameters and log block.

LABEL textString [lineNumber]
        Display the text_string in the upper left of the current window. If textString is in quotes, the optional lineNumber (range 0-5) specifies what line the text appears on.

LOG [n] [comment]
	Adds a comment to the comment buffer at line n. If n is not specified, the comment is added to the beginning of the comment buffer. If "comment" is not present, the program prompts for additional comment lines until a null comment is entered (i.e. <CR> only). If the optional "comment" is included on the same line, the text of "comment" replaces any comment already existing at line n and no further comment lines are solicited.

LMACRO
	Lists the contents in the current macro buffer.

LOOP variable_name start end [step]
	Initializes a loop. The variable_name can be any string of reasonable length. The variable takes on the initial value specified by "start" and the commands within the loop are repeated until the variable is >= "end". ( or <= "end" if step < 0) If step is not specified, a step of 1 is assumed. The end of the loop is specified by the LOOPND command. Each LOOP must have a corresponding LOOPND. To access the value of a loop variable, precede variable_name with "@" For example:
	loop fnum 2 10 2
	get data@fnum
	disp
	loopnd
	.
	.
	Note: To signify the end of a variable name when it is followed by other characters, use a '\' character. For example:
	loop fnum 2 10 2
	get data@fnum\_corrected
	disp
	loopnd

LOOPBREAK
	Break out of current loop.

LOOPND
	Specifies the end of a loop initiated with the LOOP command.

LOOKUP fn_number 
	Redefine the current image using the lookup table specified by a tabulated function. Use GETFUNCT n filename before using this command.

LTEMPIMAGE 
	List defined temporary images.

LN
	Returns the natural log of the current image.

MACRO [n m]
	Like "RMACRO [n m]" except that printing of intermediate output is automatically suppressed.

MAP minimum maximum
    Map the current image to have values between minimum and maximum.

MAKNEW n m
	Change the resolution of the data in the current data buffer to be n rows x m columns. Bilinear interpolation is performed.

MASK> value
	Create a mask based on values in the current image greater than or equal to the specified value. Mask values are 0 or 1.

MASK< value
	Create a mask based on values in the current image less than the specified value. Mask values are 0 or 1.

MATCH image2_data_file
	This command is used to create matching image pairs from images taken with different magnification, displacement, and rotation. The first image is assumed to be in the current image buffer. "image2_data_file" specifies the name of a file containing the second image. The necessary image matching parameters are stored in an ASCII text file and must be loaded with the GETMATCH command prior to executing the MATCH command. The command creates two new images and stores them in files named Match_1 and Match_2. Image 1 should be the lower resolution of the two.

MIRROR
	Form a left-right mirror image operation on the data in the current data buffer.

MULFILE <filename>
	Multiplies the contents of the current data buffer by the contents of the specified file.

MULTMPIMAGE name
	Multiplies the contents of the current data buffer by the contents of the named temporary image.

MYSQSERVER server userName password databaseName
	Opens a new connection to the named MYSQL database on the specified server (e.g., cld3.eng.yale.edu) with the userName and password specified. See also SQLNEW [qtoma command]

MYSQTABLE tableName
	Creates a table named tableName on the open MYSQL server if it doesn't already exist. The table will contain a numbered imageID and imageData containing the image displayed in the current data window. In addition, any variable name beginning with "sql" will be added as a column to the table (minus the "sql"). [qtoma command]

NEWWINDOW flag
	If flag = 1 (default), a new window will be opened for each "DISPLAY" command. If flag = 0, the results of "DISPLAY" commands will be placed in the last-opened window. If no window exists, a new one will be opened. 

NEXTFILE [prefix]
	Open the next file specified in the FileNames file that was opened with the GetFileNames command. If a prefix is specified, that is added to the name before trying to open the file. command_return_1 is the filename without any prefix and without the extension (last 4 characters). The file name needs to include the full path to the file.

NEXTFOLDER
	 Read the next entry in the FolderNames file that was opened with the GETFOLDERNAMES command. command_return_1 has the local folder name. Typically this would be saved to a variable (e.g., named "folder") for use in subsequent NEXTFILE commands.

NOISE average rms [seed]
	Creates a noise image with the specified average and rms. See also GNOISE.

NAN2ZERO
	Set any nan values to 0.

OPENFILE <filename>
	Reads data from the specified filename but does not close it. If there is more than one image in the file, the GETNEXT command will read the next image. This type of multi-image data file can be created with the CREATEFILE, CONCATFILE, CLOSEFILE commands, or may be produced by some cameras.

PIXSIZE [WindowScaleFactor]
	Specifies a scale factor used to determine the size of a window displayed. PIXSIZE 1 associates one screen point with one data point. If WindowScaleFactor is negative, a scale factor of -1/WindowScaleFactor is used. If no argument is given, the current WindowScaleFactor is printed.

PIXVALUE row column
	Prints the value of the pixel at the specified row and column. The upper left of an image is at 0,0. If the image is color, prints RGB values. command_return_1 is the value for BW images; command_return_1 - command_return_3 are RGB for color images.

POSITVE
	Sets all negative values in the image buffer to 0.  Positive values are unaffected.

POWER y
	Raise the data in the current image buffer to the power y (float).

RAMP
	Fill current image with a ramp from 0 to the number of number of channels.

RECTANGLE ulx uly lrx lry
	Specify a rectangle that calculations are to be done on. The arguments are upper left x coordinate; upper left y coordinate; lower right x; lower right y.

RGB2RED
	Get the red channel of the current color image.

RGB2GREEN
	Get the green channel of the current color image.

RGB2BLUE
	Get the blue channel of the current color image.

RGB2COLOR colorNumber
	Get the red, green, or blue channel of the current color image for colorNumber = 1, 2, or 3.

RMACRO [n m]
	Starts executing commands in the macro buffer with %d being replaced first by value n. Subsequently, n is incremented by the amount specified in the INCMACRO command (default is 1). If the new numeric value is equal to m, the macro will be executed again. Menu items can be selected and the appropriate commands executed during macros. Commands typed during the execution of a macro will be echoed to the terminal but not performed. To stop a macro during execution type "cmd ." (hold down the apple key and type ".")

ROW n
	Resets the number of rows in the current image to n.

ROTATE [value]
	Rotates the data in the current image buffer.  If no value is specified, the image is rotated by 90 degrees. If a value is specified, the image is rotated by the specified number of degrees (this may be a real number).

READBADPIX filename
	Read in bad pixel data from a text file (e.g., from a file saved with WRITEBADPIX).
	Format is:
	# of bad pixels
	detector_width	detector_height
	bad_pix1_x bad_pix1_y
	bad_pix2_x bad_pix2_y
	.
	.
	.

RNDOFF
	Round the DATAWORD values Down to the nearest integer value.

RNDUP
	Round the DATAWORD values UP to the nearest integer value.

RULER [numpix] [numunits] [unit name] 
	Can be used to specify the number of pixels that correspond to a length unit. "numpix" and "numunits" are both floating point arguments. An optional string can be included to define the units (e.g., "mm" or "feet"). If no arguments are given, the current scale factor will be printed. The scale factor defined with the RULER command is used (1) when printing lengths using the ruler tool in the status window, (2) when reporting contour lengths generated by the "Plot Contours" menu command, and (3) when reporting the x and y "center of mass" using the calculate rectangle tool in the status window. Scale factor info is saved with data files and will be reloaded automatically when the files are retrieved. To "un-define" a ruler, give only one argument.

REMAP Value1 Value2 [Value3]
	With two arguments, every occurence of Value1 in the current image is replaced with Value2. With three arguments, values in the range from Value1 to Value2 are set to Value3.

SAVEFILE <filename>
	Saves the current data buffer to the specified file.

SAVSETTINGS [filename]
	Saves the current settings to the specified file (uses the appropriate prefix and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is given, OMA Settings are saved within the oma application. 

SATIFF <filename> 
	Converts the contents of the OMA Image buffer to 8 bit unsigned data and then uses the LibTIFF TIFFWriteEncodedStrip function to save the data to a TIFF image specified on the command line. The 'save' file prefixes are used. A ".tif" extension is automatically appended to the filename. To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the flag appropriately.

SATIFFSCALED min max <filename>
	Convert image to 16 bit and save as a TIFF file. Uses the specified min and max for scaling rather than the min and max of the image in the buffer. Results will be between 0 - 65535. Depending on min and max, the image may be clipped or the full 16-bit dynamic range may not be used. To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the flag appropriately.

SAVEJPG <filename>
	Saves the current image bitmap to a JPG file. The current display parameters are used to create the bitmap. Include the .jpg extension in the file name.

SAVEPDF <filename>
	Saves the current data window image to a PDF file. Any text labels that are displayed on the data window will be part of the pdf. Include the .pdf extension in the file name.

SAVEINT <FileName> [typeOfInteger]
 Save the data to an oma2 file where the values are converted to integers. Default is typeOfInteger=16 (unsigned 16-bit integers) Other options for typeOfInteger are -16 (signed short), 8 (unsigned char), or -8 (signed char). Out of bounds values for a given type are set to the type's minimum and maximum -- this modifies the current image as well. FileName must not contain white-space characters. See also the MAP command.
 
SERCLOSE
	Closes the serial port opened with the last "SERIAL device_name" command. This can be used if you need to talk to more than one serial device -- open device 1, send commands, close the serial port, open device 2, send commands, and so forth. Available in oma2cam.

SERIAL device_name (or character_string) [baudRate Timeout]
	Provides a simple way of sending text strings to a serial device. For example, a KeySpan USB to serial converter can be used to control a variety stepping motor controllers, spectrographs, arduinos etc. The device name should be something like "/dev/tty.KeySpan1" Note that upper/lower case matters on these specifications. Look in the "/dev" directory to find the name of your specific hardware. When opening a device, the baud rate and timeout value (in thenths of seconds) can be specified. Defaults are baud = 9600 and timeout = 0. After opening the device with the first SERIAL command, subsequent SERIAL commands will send across the specified character_string, followed by a <CR>. This uses standard POSIX calls.  Available in oma2cam.

SIZE rows cols 
	Set the number of rows and columns of the current image and zero the data.

SINGRID radius
	Draw a grid from the sine function.

STEMPIMAGE name
	Save current image as temporary image with specified name. The name can be 0-9 or a text string beginning with a lower case letter. This can be retrieved with GTEMP.

STRMACRO string
	Specifies that "string" is to be substituted for any "%s" found in macro or execute commands. If no string is specified, the current string is printed.

SMOOTH [n,m]
	Performs an n x m smoothing operation on data in the current image buffer.  If only n is specified, an n x n smoothing is done; with no argument, a 2 x 2 smoothing is performed.  For the smoothing operation to be perfectly centered on each data point, the arguments must be odd. For Gaussian smoothing, use GSMOOTH.

SUBFILE <filename>
	Subtracts the contents of the specified file from the data in the current buffer.

SHELL shell_command
	Opens a pipe to a shell and sends along the command. Output from the command is echoed to the command window.

STOPONERROR flag
	If flag = 1, macro or execute commands will stop on error conditions. If flag = 0 (default) execution will continue.

SBIG command_string [parameters]
	[This command is only available in oma2cam. The SBIG drivers must be installed.]
	command_string specifies the SBIG command (listed below).
 	Only the first 3 characters of SBIG commands matter.
 	The values for parameters depend on the particular command.
	.
 	SBIG command_strings:
 	.
 	EXPosure exposure_time
		Specify exposure_time in seconds. Does not take an image.
	.
	 FILter
		 Specify which fillter to use.

	.
	 ACQuire 
		Get an image using the current settings.

SUBTMPIMAGE name
	Subtracts the contents of the named temporary image from the data in the current buffer.

SEQ2HDR filename cutoff
	Convert a sequence of images with different exposures to an HDR image. The file contains all images and must have information on exposures stored in the EXTRA data (see the EXTRA command). This type of file can be created by GigE cameras in oma2cam or can be created using the CREATEFILE/CONCATENATEFILE/COLSEFILE commands. Note that all exposure information must be entered in the extra space before CREATEFILE is used to open the file. Image values larger thatn the cutoff value will not be included and this should be close to the detector saturation value.

SEQ2IMAGE filename
	Open all frames of a sequence of images to a single image whose height is NFRAMES*FRAMEHEIGHT.

SHOTNOISE seed
	Treat the data as counts and add random root N noise to the data.

SNR gsmoothx gsmoothy aveSize
	Calculate the signal/noise ratio of the image by first gaussian smoothing the image by the specified amount, then dividing the smoothed image by the original unsmoothed image. The SNR is taken to be the rms deviation calculated over an aveSize x aveSize area (the average is assumed to be 1)centered on each pixel.

SAY string
	Say the string on the computer's speaker.

SCATTER [sizeX sizeY minX maxX minY maxY]
	Create a scatter plot of sizeX by sizeY. The current image is taken as a pair of related data sets, with X values on the top half and Y values on the bottom half. Values 3-6 specify alternate min and max values for X and Y on the scatter plot. If these arguments are omitted, the min and max of each half image is used. Default size is 250 by 250 bins in X and Y.

SETALPHA alphaValue
	Sets the alpha channel of the current data window or image window to alphaValue, where 0 <= alphaValue <=1. For example, an alphaValue of .25 would result in window transparency of 75%.

SQLADD
	Adds the current displayed image to the database table previously opened. This could be a SQLite or mySQL database.  See also MYSQSERVER and SQLNEW [qtoma command]

SQLNEW databaseName tableName
	Opens a new SQLite database file named databaseName.db and creates a table named tableNameif it doesn't already exist. If databaseName.db already exists, it is deleted and a new database started. The table will contain a numbered imageID and imageData containing the image displayed in the current data window. In addition, any variable name beginning with "sql" will be added as a column to the table (minus the "sql"). See also MYSQSERVER [qtoma command]

SQLOPEN databaseName tableName
	Opens an existing SQLite database file named databaseName.db and creates a table named tableName if it doesn't already exist. The table will contain a numbered imageID and imageData containing the image displayed in the current data window. In addition, any variable name beginning with "sql" will be added as a column to the table (minus the "sql"). [qtoma command]

SQLCLOSE
	Closes any open SQL database. [qtoma command]

TSMOOTH
	Smooth radius based on x_dim = Temp[0], y_dim = Temp[1]. This is a function that enables (Rectangular) smoothing of an image, with variable filter size. It works basically like SMOOTH 13 13, say, but it takes the x_dim and y_dim locally based on the values in the  Temporary buffers T[0] and T[1]. It has been used to variably smooth an image based on the local length scale which was modelled.

UPREFX type 
	Force use of prefix/suffix specified by 'type.' Possible cases for 'type' include the following:
	s   Use Save File prefix and suffix for both saving and getting files
	g   Use Get File prefix and suffix for both saving and getting files
	d   Use Default prefix and suffix

UNFOLD
	Treat the current image as the right half of an image and "unfold" it to create a new symmetric image.

VARIABLES
	Lists currently defined variables and their values. Variables are defined using simple arithmetic expressions, such as
	my_var = 10
	or
	y = my_var*2
	The values of variables are accessed from other commands using @my_var. For example,
	+ @my_var
	or
	save datfile_@4myvar
	As with loops, the end of a variable can be tagged by adding a '\' For example,
	save datfile_@my_var\_corrected
	See also commands FLOAT, INTVARIABLE and VARCLEAR

VARCLEAR
	Clears all user-defined variables.

VIDOPENFILE framesPerSecond filename
	Open a video file with the specified name and add the image in the last-displayed data data window to the video. The file is saved to the directory specified by Save Data Files; the extension ".avi" should be specified as part of the filename. [qtoma command]

VIDADDFRAME
	Adds the image from the last-displayed data window to the video opened with the VIDOPENFILE command. [qtoma command]

VIDCLOSEFILE
	Closes the currently open video file. This must be done after adding frames to a video. [qtoma command]

WARP subpix
	Remaps an image coordinate system using bilinear geometric warping.
	x' = a00 + a01x + a10y + a11xy
	y' = b00 + b01x + b10y + b11xy
	The 8 parameters must first be read in with the WARPARAMS command. The subpix value specifies subpixel resolution used (default is 0.2). Without subpixel sampling, there would likely be holes in the warped image.

WARPARAMS <filename>
	Reads in 8 warp parameters from the specified file. The format of the text file should be as follows:
	a00 a01 a10 a11
	b00 b01 b10 b11

WRITEBADPIX filename
	Save bad pixel data (e.g., from FINDBADPIX or READBADPIX commands) to a text file.
	Format is:
	# of bad pixels
	detector_width	detector_height
	bad_pix1_x bad_pix1_y
	bad_pix2_x bad_pix2_y
	.
	.
	.

WAITHI Channel
	Waits until the specified digital I/O channel is aserted high on a LabJack U3. Channel must be in the range 4-7. [oma2cam only]

X0 n
	Specifies that the detector is to be read out starting at column n.
